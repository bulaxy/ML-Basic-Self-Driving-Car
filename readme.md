After Looking at Tetris a bit, I decided to take a step back, to try and implement something easier to begin with. 

Followed Along This [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI) Tutorial for this basic self-driving car JS Course. 

Did not do a lot of changes to it.

Note

While I read through and understand most (if not all) of the code, I did not attempt read/understand the visualizer.js. It was a direct copy from their git repo.
